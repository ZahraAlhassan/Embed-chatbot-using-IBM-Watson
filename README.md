# Embed-chatbot-using-IBM-Watson
This task involves the use of IBM Watson technology and its cloud technology, AMI. AMI Cloud offers a range of services. One of these services is the Chatbot service. The chat is created on IBM servers. IBM is responsible for inserting the conversation on its site where it communicates with the cloud service in order to interact live with the automatic conversation. Within the IBM architecture are several languages stored in the cloud whose task is to translate words and respond to the user. When we activate the Chatbot service, we include two categories in it: Grammars and Chatting Tree. Grammars contain chat that have a specific response, for example, "AlsalamuAlicom", the response will be "WaAlicomAlsalam". So, the job of Grammers is to build a foundation that has a definite response and manages them to give me the correct answer.  Chating Tree is based on the basic Grammers that we have built. Its function is to construct the children of the entered sentence. For example, the entered sentence may be "Alsalam", or "AlsalamuAlicom" or "AlsalamuAlicom wa rahmat Allah wa barakatah". At this point, we are programming the appropriate response for the branches.
